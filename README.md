# Reddit video maker
A python script that makes reddit videos.

It opens up a r/askreddit post and takes a screeshot of the post and then of 3 comments. 
It then reads it with some tts and puts it all together into a video.
If the video is more than 40 second it takes a lot of time to make for some reason idk why.

All you need is a folder called apikeys with a redditsecret.txt and a redditclient.txt with the respective api keys.
You also need a username and password.txt file in there with that reddit accounts username and password.

It doesnt particularly want to work on a raspberrypi so im guessing it currently only works on windows
